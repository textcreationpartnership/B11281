            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bold to impart an admonition to you, and this concerning a duety of moſt great and high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance-to wit, of Catechizing.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe there cannot bee a more needfull thing ſpoken of; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which admonition ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giuen, then this: partly by reaſon of the great benefit and profit which commeth by it; and partly through the great contempt and neglect which is had of it; and partly for that a great number of theſe, by whom this duty is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, put it off from them as a buſines impertinent, and with which they ſtand not chargeable. I meane this laſt of Houſe and Schoole-gouernours.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore labour breefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you of three things: the firſt is, teaching the profit of it: ſecondly I ſhall endeuour to remoue the contempt of it: thirdly, I ſhall prooue that you (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren aboue mentioned) doe in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:16323:3"/> ſort (though not ſo fully as certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſtand chargeable therein.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, my reaſoning ſhall be onely by allegation of the ſeuerall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which flow from it: now Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is of exceeding aduantage, as in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the preaching: it is not vnknown how great the number is of theſe who enioy the preaching of the worde, and are nothing, or very ſlenderly bettered by it; this is moſt certainely one mayne cauſe thereof, the want of Catechizing; in that perſons come vnskilled thereto in the principles of religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a ſpecial courſe to be taken of him that would be a good proficient by preaching, that he be ſeen in the grounds before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the Sacrament of Baptiſme, wherein wee enter into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Couenant with Gods maieſtie, how commeth it to paſſe that ſo many thouſands who haue thus ſolemnely bound themſelues, yet are ſo farre from keeping it, that they ſcarcelie thinke of ſuch a matter? Proceedeth not this of neglect of Catechizing? And therefore as any one tendreth to receiue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:16323:4"/> of his baptiſme, it ſtandeth him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſubmit himſelfe to this kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning the Sacrament of the holy Supper, is not this generally to be held of all Chriſtians, that the ſame appertaineth not to all commers, but onely to prepared gueſts? therefore the holy Ghoſt plainely affirmeth of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, that they eate and drinke their owne iudgement: now can it bee denied that this is one ſpecial good helpe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to bee well leſſoned in all the ground points of the chriſtian doctrine?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what a ſpeciall matter is it to bee frequent in the reading of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, concerning which, the commandement of our heauenly maſter, is expreſſe for all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life; and they are they which witneſſe of me:</hi> hereby we are made wiſe vnto ſaluation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. now certaine it is, that without Catechizing, the Scriptures will be as a ſealed booke: and therefore as we haue in regard the reading of Gods booke, to receiue edification and comfort by it, it is needfull we be skilled in the principles before.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:16323:4"/>
            <p> Fiftly, can there bee a more notable preſeruatiue, to keepe vs ſafe from the multitude of ſeducers and impoſtors in the world, as Ieſuites and Seminaries? How many are peruerted by them? for they compaſſe ſea and land, to make of their profeſſion, that they may make them the children of hell like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, I will not ſay two-fold worſe; for that I ſuppoſe cannot be: witneſſe their many treacheries and conſpiracies, and eſpecially that gunne-powder buſineſſe, which argue their attainment to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this kind. If falſe Prophets may be knowne by their fruits, which is the rule of our maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. then it is no hard matter for theſe who will apply themſelues to diſcerning of ſpirits (the which we are counſelled, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1.) to finde out of what ſpirit they are: but concerning theſe that haue beene ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by them, hath there beene a more chiefe cauſe then neglect of inſtruction in the grounds of the true religion?</p>
            <p>Sixtly, what a rich treaſure is the feare of God? the want whereof <hi>Abraham</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing in a country where hee was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourning, doubted of villanies to bee
<pb facs="tcp:16323:5"/> done him and his wife: <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>the feare of God is not in this place, and they will ſlay me for my wiues ſake, Gen.</hi> 20. This is it which keepeth the ſubiect from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie againſt his Prince and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9. 10. 11. which is the ground of dutifulneſſe in children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their parents, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lord.</hi> This is the chaine that tieth ſeruants to due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their maſters, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 5. 6. 7. 8. This is it that holdeth perſons from breaking forth into lewdneſſe of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: <hi>How can I</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ill miſtreſſe) <hi>doe this great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and ſo ſin againſt God? Gen.</hi> 39. 9.</p>
            <p>Now is it poſſible that this treaſure of Gods feare can be, except there be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge going before? and is there againe a more direct way for this, then inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the principles of Chriſtianitie?</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, what is catechizing in the very nature of it, but as it were a taking of any one by the hand, to lift him vp out of the dungeon of darkneſſe, and to bring him into the light and ſight of Chriſt crucified, the which alone doth yeeld iuſtification, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. 11. and life
<pb facs="tcp:16323:5"/> eternall, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. So that catechizing is a moſt ſpeciall pole to lift vp the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent, the onely beholding of which perfectly cureth that deadly wound which that fiery Serpent of hell gaue vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. If therefore the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt crucified be in price and account with vs, (the which <hi>Paul</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſuch excellencie, that all things of this world herewith compared, hee reckoned them to bee dung and filth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.) then ought this exerciſe to be in requeſt with vs, as being without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie greatly requiſite to the getting and procuring of that worthy ſcience.</p>
            <p>There may be added an eighth bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: The doctrine of the Goſpell is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9. yea a great myſterie, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and euery one by his birth is a perſon naturall, and <hi>the naturall man perceiueth not the things that are of God,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. This being ſo, it may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how neceſſary catechizing is, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a familiar and plaine inſtruction in the grounds of doctrine.</p>
            <p>A ninth conſideration of the benefit of this is hereby euident: Chriſtians are all of two ſorts; either they are babes,
<pb facs="tcp:16323:6"/> through being lately new borne, or they haue attained to ſome good growth, and they haue their wits exerciſed to diſcerne both good and euill. This diſtinction the holy Ghoſt ſetteth downe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13. 14. Now how many are there of the former ranke? (yea and it were well if they were come to this) and as for theſe, they haue need of milke, and not ſtrong meat, as the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And will you know what hee meaneth there by milke? he expreſſeth himſelfe a little before, calling it the firſt principles of the word of God: and could hee haue ſpoken more plainly?</p>
            <p>The laſt benefit, which is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole: Catechizing is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the eſtabliſhing of perſons for a fixed and ſetled ſtanding in grace. <hi>If yee continue in my word</hi> (ſaith our heauenly Maſter) <hi>then are yee my Diſciples, Ioh.</hi> 8. 31. Now hereunto this kinde of exerciſe (by the confeſſion of all) is ſingularly expedient. It is a common title giuen to the principles of religion, that they are called grounds, which is a very fit appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as being to notifie, that all ſuch who are not skilled in theſe principles,
<pb facs="tcp:16323:6"/> are as a building which ſtands vpon no firme ground. Therefore euery one that mindeth in good earneſt the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, had need to looke to his ground, that it be ſure enough. <hi>All that will liue godly</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.) muſt ſuffer perſecution: and therefore without firme ſetling not any one may looke to hold out againſt ſuch ſtormes and tempeſts.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice to haue beene ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the benefits by catechizing, the which as diuers coards twiſted together, may make as a great cable to draw and pull any vnto it.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place, I am to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour about remoueall of the contempt, wherein this noble exerciſe is: and here, albeit the former conſideration, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profits ariſing by it, may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this, yet whereas profit is one thing, and dignitie or excellencie is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will here alleage what concerneth this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhould catechizing ſeeme a baſe and vile matter in our eyes, which God in the depth of his wiſdome hath inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an ordinance of his, to helpe his
<pb facs="tcp:16323:7"/> elect to the faith of Chriſt, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them therein? This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Paul</hi> vſed in his plea for preaching, which otherwiſe was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fooliſhneſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Here then may I ſay this of catechizing: Bee it in the account of the greater number a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and weake thing, yet certainly it is Gods fooliſhneſſe, which is wiſer then men, and Gods weakneſſe, which is ſtronger then men, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhould that be contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with vs, the carefull and diligent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of which, hath made certaine, though otherwiſe much accepted, yet to be the more honourable with God? <hi>Abraham</hi> for example: It is true that his faith properly made his perſon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and 39. yet his diligentneſſe about the inſtructing of his familie in the way of the Lord, did make him the more acceptable; and therfore for this very act God maketh him of his priuie counſell: <hi>Shall I hide</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>from Abraham the thing that I will doe? For I know him, that he will command his ſons &amp; his houſhold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, Ge.</hi> 18. 17. 19.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:16323:7"/>
            <p> Thirdly, if antiquitie and ancientie may procure reuerence, (as it ought to doe when it is not ſeuered from truth) certainly catechizing is not deſtitute of this.</p>
            <p>In the Eccleſiaſticall ſtorie there is mention made of diuers Catechiſts, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus, Clemens, Origen,</hi> and other which were in the Primitiue Church, or very ſhortly vpon the ſame, that tooke great paines in this kinde. More then this, it is euident that in the Apoſtles times it was in practiſe, as is plaine both by the fift to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> verſ. 12. 13. and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſixt, verſ. 1. 2. young <hi>Timothie,</hi> as he was brought vp by his mother <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and grandmother <hi>Loys,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from his childhood, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. ſo doubtleſſe he was in this kinde alſo. Further then this, in the times of the old Teſtament there is mention made of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> how he was taught and inſtructed by his mother, <hi>Prou.</hi> the laſt: <hi>The words of King Lemuel, the prophecie that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond all this, it is plaine that in the times of the Patriarkes catechizing was practiſed. That <hi>Iacob</hi> vſed it, it is plaine
<pb facs="tcp:16323:8"/> by <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. <hi>Then ſaid Iacob to his houſhold, and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange gods that are among you, and cleanſe your ſelues.</hi> Now it may not otherwiſe be thought, but that this holy Patriarke, as he tooke ſtraight order for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the falſe gods, ſo his care was as great in the informing them in the knowledge of the true God, and in the right worſhip of him. And as for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that hee vſed it, it is euident by <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. the place formerly alleaged.</p>
            <p>Yea it aſcendeth to the ſupremeſt height of antiquitie, which is to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe: for in that his two ſonnes did ſo applie themſelues to the worſhip and religious ſeruice of God, it is certaine (howſoeuer it be not literally expreſſed) that this came to paſſe by being catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and inſtructed therein, by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, this maketh not a little for the high reputation of catechizing, in that all the reformed Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtendome doe vrge and require the practiſe of it: wherein what doe they otherwiſe then giue an honourable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie vnto it?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:16323:8"/>
            <p> Laſtly (which onely might ſuffice, if there were no more ſpoken for it) Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing is of ordinance Apoſtolicall; and ſo it is not of humane inuention, but it hath Iehoua himſelfe to be the founder of it. This is plaine by <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hauing before ſpoken of the needful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, whereas he ſaith, <hi>Ye haue need againe that wee teach you the firſt principles of the word of God,</hi> then doth hee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward relate the Catechiſme it ſelfe in the maine 2. principall points of it, which he tearmeth repentance from dead workes, and faith towards God: he mentioneth alſo the two ſorts of perſons of whom it was required, to wit, the Conuerts before they were baptized, which he meaneth by the doctrine of Baptiſmes, and the children of Beleeuers ſo ſoone as they came to diſcretion, which hee meaneth by the laying on of hands, becauſe theſe little ones after ſuch exerciſes performed by them, had the hands, to wit, of the Paſtors, laid on them.</p>
            <p>Thus wee haue ſeene of theſe two points, to wit, the great profits which come by catechizing, and alſo that there is no vileneſſe in it, ſo as any one may
<pb facs="tcp:16323:9"/> deſpiſe it; but contrariwiſe to bee had in great regard by any perſons whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>There remaineth now this third to be ſhowne, which is that you (my brethren) who are Parents, Maſters, and Schoole-gouernours, haue an intereſt in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, I meane that in ſome ſort you ſtand chargeable for the practiſe of this dutie of catechizing.</p>
            <p>Farre be it from mee to lay any yoke on your neckes, or burden on your backes, other then that which is Chriſts, to which euery one muſt ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. eſpecially ſithence his yoke is eaſie, and burden is light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 30. He is that great, yea and only Law-giuer to the conſcience, and therefore theſe that deſire to bee in the number of his good ſubiects, muſt not denie him obedience, as in other, ſo in this dutie.</p>
            <p>Now how ſhall this appeare? Euen eaſily if wee acknowledge that all the whole Scripture is only his word, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as is ſaid, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell plenteouſly in you,</hi> meaning thereby the whole doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But let vs goe to the matter. And
<pb facs="tcp:16323:9"/> firſt I reaſon thus: Euery Chriſtian is by his calling a Prophet, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 12. and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that if we partake with Chriſt in his two greater offices, to wit, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Kingdome, <hi>Ren</hi> 1. 6. we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the leſſer alſo, which is of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. Now then if euery common Chriſtian ought to bee a Teacher, how much more you, whoſe callings, though not publike, yet are more ſpeciall then ordinary?</p>
            <p>Secondly, thus I argue: The husband oweth this dutie to teach the wife, as is plaine by 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. <hi>If they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home:</hi> now ſhe is a perſon of ſuperioritie in a familie; then much more is this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be performed to thoſe that are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the inferiours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the expreſſe commands of God are many and diuers for this dutie: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt rehearſe them continually vnto thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſhalt talke of them when thou tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt in thine houſe.</hi> Likewiſe verſ. 20. <hi>If thy ſonne ſhall aske thee in time to come, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What meane theſe teſtimonies and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16323:10"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c. then thou ſhalt ſay vnto thy ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>God eſtabliſhed a teſtimonie in Iacob, and ordained a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our Fathers, that they ſhould teach their children, that the poſteritie might know it, and the children which ſhould be borne, ſhould ſtand vp and declare it to their children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the new Teſtament, very pregnant is that which is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Ye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in inſtruction and information of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I thus argue: You that are Parents and Schoole-gouernours, owe loue vnto your children and Pupils, for this is a common debt which we owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. much more vnto them. Now this loue muſt be in deed, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. and can there bee a more ſpeciall worke of loue, then to helpe them to that ſcience, which yeeldeth for its bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit life eternall, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, thoſe that profeſſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, are by their calling <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. Now they that will be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, muſt neceſſarily (as Truth it ſelfe hath affirmed) doe the
<pb facs="tcp:16323:10"/> workes of <hi>Abraham, Ioh.</hi> 8. 39. Now this was one of his workes, as may bee ſeene <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. of which alſo God did take eſpeciall notice.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it is your deſire, that at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times, eſpecially at Eaſter, they ſhould come to the Sacrament, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thereof: now in comming vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, what other doe they then eat and drinke vnto themſelues iudgement? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and ſhould not you take pitty on them in this reſpect, and apply your beſt endeuours, that they may not turne vnto their bane, which by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is appointed the food to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, you that are Parents and Maſters, deſire greatly to haue your children dutifull and obedient, alſo your ſeruants faithfull and diligent; and can there be a more notable means then catechizing, for the effecting of this, whereby their hearts may bee ſeaſoned with grace, and conſequently fit fruits will be following?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, what is a Chriſtian familie but a little Church? ſo is it tearmed in diuers places, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. and <hi>Philem.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16323:11"/> verſe 2. <hi>To the Church which is in thy houſe:</hi> therefore ſuch a ſpeciall holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe as is Catechizing, ſhould not be as a ſtranger therein.</p>
            <p>I omit further allegations (beloued brethren) concerning this catechizing dutie to be performed by you: it is God only that hath the perſwaſiue power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
            <p>I will onely ſatisfie a demand or two, and ſo I will end. One is, wherefore I am ſilent concerning the Miniſters, for the executing of this catechizing buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: I anſwer, for that generally it is held for a dutie whereto they are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whereas concerning other it is not. And hence it is ſtrange to mee, that all thoſe who make conſcience of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doe not alſo of catechizing, which is equally commanded, and rather more then leſſe profitable. Secondly, That if the Miniſters doe their duties, there may be no more required then their care to preſent them to the Miniſter: I anſwer, that except they doe ſomething in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, the profit by the publike may bee endangered: but if this be neglected in the publike, then it ſtandeth you the
<pb facs="tcp:16323:11"/> more vpon, that your ſelues be labourers in the worke.</p>
            <p>If here it be ſaid, the matter is too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be done by you, I anſwer, if you only command your companies to learne theſe principles, and to vtter the ſame to you, this is a ſmall matter; and then there are ſo many helpes by thoſe who haue written vpon the grounds of Religion, that at the leaſt ſome of thoſe being procured, there may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with great facilitie performed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly ſpecifie ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Treatiſe which here is put forth, and ſo I will end. I haue for the method altogether followed the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Catechiſme: for the matter, I haue vſed libertie therein, as other haue done before me in the ſelfe-ſame booke.</p>
            <p>The points here ſet downe, I hope haue euery one of them good warrant.</p>
            <p>There are ſome perſons, for whom I haue done it, who I know will make vſe of it; and indeed for them I tooke this buſineſſe, ſuch as it is, in hand.</p>
            <p>Yet I haue beene bold to hang out a garland, becauſe this kinde of mine, howſoeuer good, is in ſmall requeſt, I
<pb facs="tcp:16323:12"/> meane of catechizing in generall.</p>
            <p>Now I deſire you (good brethren) to take my former admonitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations in good part, and to accept theſe my poore endeuours in the forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this ſo needfull an exerciſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo I commend you to Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious inclining and directing you for all his good ordinances: and I heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to vouchſafe to all vs his elect and called ones of his purpoſe, through a grace that was giuen vs through Chriſt before the world was, that wee may bee made perfect in all good workes, to doe his will, working in vs that which is pleaſant in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
